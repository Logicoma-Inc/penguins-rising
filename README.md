[Penguins Rising](http://www.penguinsontherise.appspot.com/)
==============

Peguins Rising
Orginally inspired and created by Devroy Queen and Andrew Peek. Using an old game development tool kit on the windows xp. 
This is a port for the browser and the base line of the game functions as well as game play.

For a while now I have playing with idea in my head how Penguins Rising can become much more than a small scale game and release it to the largest audience possible.  

- Android/IOS (tower Defence?) 
- Win8/Website (no changes) 
- Gaming Console (next and current Gens?)
