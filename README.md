Originally inspired by Devroy Queen and Andrew Peek. Colleagues of mine who used an old version of [YOYO game's](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio) tool kit back in 2008. This is a port that expands far from the original material but uses their work as a base. It was first targeted towards browsers and used to experiement with hybrid web development.
