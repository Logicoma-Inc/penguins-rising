Originally inspired by Devroy Queen and Andrew Peek. Colleagues of mine who used an old version of [YOYO game's](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio) tool kit back in 2008. This is a port that expands far from the original material but uses their work as a base. It was first targeted towards browsers and used to experiement with hybrid web development.

A game where penguins have overtaken Antarctica and as a last stand a group of scientists have set up a post to fight off the fleet of penguins. This is a game based loosely on an older game create by a group of friends in high school.
